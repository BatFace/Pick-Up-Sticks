# Pick-Up-Sticks
An HTML/JavaScript implementation of the game Pick-up-sticks.

[Demo](http://batface.github.io/Pick-Up-Sticks/)

Set up for development with JetBrains WebStorm, but game will run just from the main index.html file.

## Browser Compatibility
Desktop - Manually tested in Firefox 36 and Chrome 40.

## Known Issues
* Incompatible with Internet Explorer due to use of numeric input ([CanIUse:input-number](http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-number))
* Hammering the play/pause button causes the loss of a fraction of a second with every click

## TODO List
* Replace numeric input with a solution that works in more browsers
* Replace/fix timer
* Make the whole thing responsive
* Add in-game instructions/help, as method for entering levels into numeric input field is probably not obvious
* Have different game modes where you don't have to enter the level manually and the time limit is not always 30 seconds!
